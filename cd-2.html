<p><strong>FPA 289</strong> is a post-modern course in music appreciation.You will develop a critical ear and advanced listening skills through the presentation of a diversity of music from many
    cultures, styles, and periods, in an effort to discover similarities, differences, and defining characteristics.You will build your Music Appreciation repertoire around basic style
    characteristics such as rhythm, harmony, melody, timbre, and texture. We will cover such general topics as form, song, political music, technology, story telling, background music, sacred
    music, improvisation, dance music, women in music, and others.</p>

<p>This is not a course, like so many other music appreciation courses, designed to create new subscribers to the local symphony orchestra. I will not be attempting to "educate" listeners in the
    joys of European art music from 1760-1890 (the boundaries within which many symphony orchestras define themselves). Instead, I hope to make you have a better understanding about the
    similarities and differences between various musical styles and types.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you will develop <strong>critical listening skills</strong>, or the ability to understand and discuss music on a more informed level. Maybe you will understand better about why you
    may like a certain style of music, and why you may not like another style as much. And in the process, I'll introduce you to some music that may have similar characteristics, which you may
    then also enjoy and understand better.</p>

<p>All this will be done without any necessary previous knowledge of music theory, music history, or even the ability to read music.</p>

<h3>Music and the European Art-music Tradition</h3>

<p>Most courses about music deal mainly with the European "high-art" musical tradition - the music of Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, etc. They may also include a glance at jazz and some popular music,
    and perhaps some music from other cultures. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, the perceived need to "educate" listeners, so that they can "appreciate" the art music from this tradition.
    While the European tradition has undeniably created a wealth of wonderful music, most musicians today recognize that it is only a portion of the available music in contemporary culture. While
    it is important to understand why Beethoven is regarded as a genius, it is equally important to understand the importance of rhythm and blues to the evolution of rock music, and even the
    importance of African tribal music to rock, for example.</p>

<p>Therefore, a course such as this will attempt to be much more inclusive about all music. However, this brings up the second reason why this type of course relies so heavily upon the European
    tradition - the lack of source material outside this tradition. Since about the year 800, musicians in Europe (monks for the first 700 years!) have been writing down music, and these written
    documents have remained with us. As a result, we can look back upon this music, and compare it to music beforehand and afterward, and thus understand its relationship.</p>

<p>Outside the European art-music tradition, most music is within the oral tradition. This means that it is passed down from generation to generation by teaching it firsthand, without ever writing
    it down. As a result, it can be changed quite dramatically with each passing, with the original versions lost forever. Therefore, we can never understand the evolution of such music
    directly.</p>

<p>In the last one hundred years, recording technology has allowed researchers to record musicians and performances, documenting them in a permanent state. This not only applies to the study of
    world music, but also commercial music as well. For example, the early Sun Studio recordings of Elvis Presley display his (and the producers) unique combination of rockabilly and rhythm and
    blues.</p>


<h3>Music in Culture</h3>

<p>Each culture possesses its own musical language, which reflects its own traditions, concerns, and activities. To begin to understand the music of any culture, we need to understand something of
    the nature of its cultural systems and the role that music plays in them. For example, this goes for the music of the Middle Ages in Europe, Hindustani music, or 1960s acid rock.</p>
<h4>Music in Contemporary North America</h4>

<p>Where do we hear music in today's society?</p>

<p>Obviously, music is all around us -</p>
<ul>
    <li>we hear it in our cars,</li>
    <li>over loudspeakers in malls,</li>
    <li>through headphones from our portable CD players,</li>
    <li>on TV during commercials,</li>
    <li>in movies as background.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these different settings have one thing in common - we are hearing recorded music. While this is one important facet of music that we will look at later in the course, let's limit our
    first look at music to settings that we can hear music played live - by real musicians. What are the different types of music that we hear today in North America? How do they differ?</p>
<h4>Classical Music</h4>

<p>An elitist activity - performances are very formal. Members of the audience sit listening very quietly until the end of each piece. Most of the music that is performed in these concerts was
    composed in previous centuries. Society treats the music of the past with great reverence - there is a written musical tradition stretching back over 1000 years (though most of the music is
    between 100 to 300 years old). Concerts often feature the same pieces by the same composers, from one concert to another, year after year.</p>
<h4>Popular Music</h4>

<p>Most young people listen to this music Much simpler and less formal than classical music. Still highly structured (the same from performance to performance). Often listened to in recorded and
    convenient formats - in personal spaces, such as their own rooms, or via personal listening (CD/MP3 players).</p>

<p>However, concerts are still an important part of popular music. These concerts are very informal - audiences may talk, sing, or shout - the music is often played so loudly it doesn't matter.
    Another important venue is the club, in which audiences dance to the music. Almost all the music is song, involving text - most texts are about love or sex. Some performers/creators are
    rewarded financially completely out of proportion with other members of society (for example, doctors that can save lives&hellip;)</p>
<h4>Jazz</h4>

<p>Performed in caf&eacute;s, nightclubs, bars. Also informal - audiences talk and drink during performance. Performers improvise, changing their performances from night to night. Small audiences,
    performers often of African descent.</p>
<h4>Functional Music</h4>

<p>We would also hear live music during parades.</p>

<p>Such marching bands have military overtones (and a military history), and often serve to mark patriotic and community events. The same can be said for pep bands and marching bands at football
    games. Music is played at the beginning of sporting events (the National Anthems of the teams involved).</p>

<p>Many people's most direct contact with music is when music is used purely for functional means: to stir emotions during movies, television, even commercials.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The use of music primarily for entertainment</li>
    <li>The naturalness of a schism between popular and classical music</li>
    <li>The existence of a fixed repertory of ancient masterworks</li>
    <li>The use of music to divide groups as well as to reinforce the sense of membership within groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not necessarily found in other cultures. Even the idea that music should be enjoyable to listen to is not even engrained in our own culture.</p>


<h3>Glossary</h3>
<dl style="position: relative;">
    <dt style="padding-top: 0.5em;">Pitch</dt>
    <dd>- a specific note that we can hear as having a frequency which we can sing back. Most instruments produce pitches; many percussion instruments (i.e drums and bells) do not.</dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Melody</dt>
    <dd>- several pitches played consecutively: the horizontal construction of music. In general, a melody stretches for a long period, even the whole composition. Melodies can have repeated
        notes, or have steps, and/or leaps. These contribute to the melody's shape.
    </dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Phrase</dt>
    <dd>- melodies can be broken down into phrases, just as a story can be broken down into sentences. A phrase can be thought of as the longest period a singer can sing.</dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Cadence</dt>
    <dd>- how musical phrases end, giving the sense of pause or closure.</dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Interval</dt>
    <dd>- the vertical distance between two notes. The notes can be played at the same time (a harmonic interval) or successively (a melodic interval).</dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Semitone</dt>
    <dd>- the smallest difference between pitches in the Western musical system. The difference between any two successive notes on a piano. A whole tone, often simply referred to as tone, is the
        intervalic distance resulting from the combination of two semitones. Thus, on the piano, play one note, skip the next semitone, and then play the next note.
    </dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Octave</dt>
    <dd>- the specific relationship between two pitches that have half, or double, the frequency of one another. It is the most basic of musical relationships: for example, women will tend to sing
        one octave higher than men.
    </dd>
    <dd>The octave relationship is so important in music that the two different pitches are considered equivalent: we give them the same name: a pitch that has a frequency of 440 Hertz is called
        "A", while a different pitch of 880 Hertz is also called "A". Similarly "C" occurs as 130.8 Hertz, 261.6 Hertz, 523.2 Hertz, etc.).
    </dd>
    <dd>An octave contains 12 semitones.</dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Scale</dt>
    <dd>- an ordered set of pitches, related to a single pitch (the tonic, or root), with each pitch separated by a specific interval. If the scale is ordered by increasing pitches, it is
        ascending; if it is ordered by descending pitches, it is descending. Because of octave equivalence, scales are usually limited to one octave.
    </dd>
    <dd>While many different methods of organising pitches into scales are possible, by far the most common scale is the major scale. The major scale uses a particular pattern of (whole) tone
        (<strong>T</strong>) and semitone (<strong>S</strong>) intervals:
    </dd>
    <dd style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>T T S T T T S</strong></span></dd>
    <dd>The same scale can begin on different pitches, using the same interval pattern.</dd>
    <dd>In this diagram, the piano keyboard's white and black notes are indicated in the white and dark columns. Scale beginning on different pitches (listed at left) are given, with the number 1
        indicating the first pitch of that scale.
    </dd>
    <dd style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 2em;"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/18/MajorScales.svg/500px-MajorScales.svg.png"
            alt="This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License." width="500" height="460"/></dd>
    <dd>Although we can speak of intervals in general, we often speak of them in relation to a scale, specifically their distance from the tonic/root. Thus, the second pitch after the tonic has an
        interval of a second (between that pitch and the tonic), the third note after the tonic has an interval of a third, etc.
    </dd>
    <dd>Although scales are an important organising aspect of music, they are rarely heard in actual music.</dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Triad</dt>
    <dd>- the specific combination of three pitches in which successive notes are skipped (i.e. 1 3 5, 2 4 6, etc.). A triad can be built on any scale note.</dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Chord</dt>
    <dd>- a vertical collection of pitches, played simultaneously. Technically, a triad is a chord, although we tend to think of chords as having more than three notes.</dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Harmony</dt>
    <dd>- the organization of pitch material, both vertical (chords) and horizontal (melodic). We often speak of it as an accompaniment to melody, while it is used to organize the melodic material
        itself.
    </dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Tonality / Functional Tonality</dt>
    <dd>- the relationship between chords. More specifically, the harmonic organization that started around 1600, and has continued to exist (in certain types of music) until today. Generally, it
        means that the harmony is organized around a single pitch (the "tonic") and a strict relationship of other pitches to this key pitch. All pitches, both melodic and harmonic, have a
        functional relationship to the key pitch, in that they serve to move towards it, or towards another related pitch.
    </dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Harmonic Progression</dt>
    <dd>- a collection of chords that suggest movement, most often towards a goal. This goal is usually the existing tonic, or a new tonic.</dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Diatonic</dt>
    <dd>- the collection of pitches limited to a major and/or minor tonic. This music is functional, and the most simple type of tonality.</dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Modes</dt>
    <dd>- a collection of pitches that relate to major and minor keys, but are slightly different (most often lacking the necessary leading tone, a pitch in functional tonality that leads back to
        the tonic). As a result, modal music sounds very similar to diatonic music, but lacks the "pull" back to the tonic.
    </dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Consonance and Dissonance</dt>
    <dd>- the quality of certain intervals. If an interval is considered "pleasing", it is considered consonant, and thought to be stable. Those that seem unstable are considered dissonant, and
        require resolution to a stable interval. It is this notion of movement - from unstable intervals to stable - that gives music a sense of progression in time: the use of tension (unstable
        intervals) and release (movement to stable intervals).
    </dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Rhythm</dt>
    <dd>- the organization of time in music. All music has rhythm, even if it lacks a pulse or beat, since all music is organized in time.</dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Bar / measure</dt>
    <dd>- the organization of beats into a small repeating group. Most often, this consists of a group of four (i.e. four-four time) The 20th century began to explore many variations of this
        grouping (i.e. Igor Stravinsky).
    </dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Tempo</dt>
    <dd>- the relative speed of each beat / pulse. In classical music, different words (usually Italian) indicate different tempi:<em>Largo</em> (slowly), <em>Moderato</em> (moderate),
        <em>Allegro</em> (quickly), <em>Presto</em> (very fast). These are only a few standard tempo; there are many different indications. However, all are relative: how fast is fast, exactly?
    </dd>
    <dd>For this reason, tempo indications often include a beats per minute, such as 120 BPM (a brisk walking tempo, or march tempo).</dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Dynamics</dt>
    <dd>- changes in musical loudness. Like tempo, these indications are most often given in Italian:
        <ol>
            <li>Very soft, <em>pianissimo</em>, or<em>pp</em></li>
            <li>Soft, <em>piano</em>, or<em>p</em></li>
            <li>Medium soft, <em>mezzo piano</em>, or<em>mp</em></li>
            <li>Medium loud, <em>mezzo forte</em>, or<em>mf</em></li>
            <li>Loud, <em>forte</em>, or<em>f</em></li>
            <li>Very loud, <em>fortissimo</em>, or<em>ff</em></li>
        </ol>
    </dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Section</dt>
    <dd>- a period of music that is unified by one or more features, and is heard as being different from other periods due to change in one or more of these features. An analogy could be made to
        a paragraph, where a phrase is a sentence, and the new idea exists within the new paragraph (section).
    </dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Form</dt>
    <dd>- the overall shape of the music, most often the collection of sections. The most difficult of concepts to grasp for the listener, because it can occur over long periods of time - from a
        three minute song of popular music, to a 30 minute movement of a symphony.
    </dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Texture</dt>
    <dd>- the way in which different musical sounds are combined.</dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Melody and Accompaniment</dt>
    <dd>- the most common musical texture, in which a clear melody is accompanied by chords. This is an example of a<strong>homophonic</strong> texture.</dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Polyphony</dt>
    <dd>- a musical texture that has more than one part, in which all parts are considered equal. Polyphony was the dominant musical texture of the Renaissance, and carried over into the Baroque
        Period.
    </dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Counterpoint</dt>
    <dd>- a system used to create polyphonic music. Music written in this system is called <strong>contrapuntal.</strong></dd>
    <dt style="padding-top: 1em;">Timbre</dt>
    <dd>- the tone colour of a sound. Given a note played by flute and trumpet that is the same pitch, the same dynamic, and the same duration, we can easily tell them apart due to the difference
        in the timbre.
    </dd>
